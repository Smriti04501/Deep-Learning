### Case study-GameStop stock prices predictions: 
The deep learning project uses the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) RNN network architecture to predict stock prices of a company in future. 
LSTM models are capable of handling long term dependencies and because they can store large amounts of historical data, they are frequently used in sequence prediction problems. Features like open price, close price and volume of stocks traded were taking into consideration and fed to the DL model to predict close price of stocks in 2021.
